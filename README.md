### Quantum  Many-Body Simulations in Haskell
    
###  Abstract
  
  Applying numerical methods in quantum mechanics has always been necessary in analyzing complex structures of quantum mechanical systems. The technical progress of computer performance has enabled physicists and mathematicians to simulate complex many-body systems. With these methods tangible progress in quantum physics can be made, to analyze quantum phenomena on the level of many-particle interactions. This article focuses on the implementation of numerical methods for many-body simulation in the functional programming language ```Haskell``` . Functional programming languages get more and more interesting for physicists through their mathematical way of implementation. In this article simple quantum systems are simulated first and an overview of different numerical methods for solving the Schr√∂dinger equation will be given following an attempt to proceed to many-body systems from simple quantum systems.
